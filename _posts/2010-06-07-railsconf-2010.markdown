I'm off to [RailsConf][railsconf] in Baltimore. This should be a great conference. Rails 3 will be a centerpiece. I'm particularly looking forward to learing about all the great scalability solutions including Redis and the various No-SQL storage solutions.

I'm going to go to more UI and Javascript talks this year. I'm very experienced on the back end solutions so I want to look at things I don't know as well. Also plan to explore the test driven talks. I've been at odds with both RSpec and Cucumber and would like to overcome that.

I'm going to try out [Tumblr][tumblr] for quick posts I come across during the conference. I also plan to do a daily write up.
